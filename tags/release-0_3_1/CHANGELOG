CHANGES
=======

0.3.1	2012/10/30
  - Allow extra data columns to have more than two columns (characters and value are the first two columns in these cases)
  - Updated CC-CEDICT to 10/30/2012

0.3.0	2012/10/03

  - New dictionary: chardict-unihan_readings.u8 (character dictionary with definitions from Unihan)
  - New extra data fields in Simplified: character_cloze-lcmc and  character_cloze-leeds-web-corpus (useful for flashcards)
  - Modified data field simplified/old_HSK_Levels: Merge data from wiktionary and hskflashcards, which differe in a few places
  - CC-CEDICT updated to 10/3/2012

Bug fixes:
  - remove print statements, so won't crash when console isn't unicode
  - include the english field when deciding whether to merge entries. There will be some duplication now (though not much when using the merged-cedict-refs dictionary), but it won't be throwing out rows where traditional variants had different English
  - WindowsError is OS-specific and crashes in Linux because it's undefined. Remap it to OSError
